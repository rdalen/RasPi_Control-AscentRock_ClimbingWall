# Raspberry Pi control for the Ascent FunRock Climbing wall
This project makes it possible to control your [Ascent FunRock Rotating Climbing wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9913A6JC2e4) using a Raspberry Pi.
The climbing wall is originally controlled by a windows computer via a serial interface.
There are several [projects](https://github.com/james-schaefer/climbing_wall) that hack the serial protocol to enable control from e.g. a linux computer. 
In this project the PIC controller on the Control&sensor board in the Ascent Rock controlbox is replaces by a interface-adapter to a Raspberry Pi
